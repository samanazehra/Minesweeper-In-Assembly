Tentative Minesweeper Game Plan
By Your Highness/Majesty samana zehra
For n peasants: fizza and saahil

👤 Member 1 – Board Setup & Display
For peasant no. 1 fizza
This member owns the foundation of the game (the playing field).

Responsibilities:
•	Board Initialization: Declare a 2D array to represent the board (hidden values: mines, numbers, empty). A second array to track player view (what’s revealed vs hidden).
•	Mine Placement Algorithm: Use Irvine32’s random number generator to scatter mines across the grid. Ensure no duplicates when placing mines (re-roll if needed).
•	Adjacency Logic: For each non-mine cell, calculate how many mines are around it (8-direction check). Store these numbers in the hidden array.
•	Console Display Procedures: Write a PrintBoard PROC that prints the player’s view of the board. Use characters like # for hidden cells, numbers for revealed, and * for mines (endgame only).

✅ Deliverables: A procedure that, when called, prints the current state of the board correctly.

👤 Member 2 – Input & Reveal Mechanics
For n queen samana
This member handles the interaction and recursion.

Responsibilities:
•	User Input: Take row/col as string input and convert to integers. Validate: ensure inputs are inside the grid and not already revealed.
•	Reveal Logic: If user hits a mine → signal loss. If number cell → reveal only that cell. If empty cell → recursively reveal neighbours until numbers are reached (implement recursion using stack frames to show off procedures + recursion).
•	Error Handling: Invalid inputs should re-prompt without crashing.

✅ Deliverables: A procedure that, given coordinates, updates the player’s board and handles recursive reveals.


👤 Member 3 – Game Flow & State Management
For peasant no. 2 killer ismail saahil
This member manages the engine that ties everything together.

Responsibilities:
•	Game Loop: While game is active: call Member 1’s display, call Member 2’s input/reveal, update moves and check conditions.
•	Win/Lose Conditions: Lose if mine is revealed, win if all safe cells are revealed, keep a counter of unrevealed safe cells to know when the player wins.
•	Endgame Handling: Reveal full board and print a big “YOU WIN” or “YOU LOSE” message.
•	Replay Option (optional): Ask player if they want to play again without restarting program, reinitialize board and restart loop.

✅ Deliverables: A PROC that manages turns, calls other members’ routines, and decides the game outcome.
